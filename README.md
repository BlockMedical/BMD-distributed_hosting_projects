# BMD Distributed Hosting Projects
The raw sensor data will be stored on public distributed file storage protocols such as IPFS[2] via BlockMed open
source API[3] (See Figure 1). This not only enables other technology and framework such as IoT Fog/Edge computing framework proposed by Cisco[4] to take advantage of IPFS that has better performance than others such as Amazon S3[5], but also shows better performance gain with IPFS[6]. While we have chosen IPFS to start, we are not limited by IPFS, we are also researching other technologies including protocols and actual distributed storages such as BitTorrent, StorJ, Dat, etc.
